# Improper Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches user data from a database but lacks robust error handling.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Bug
The original code fails to handle potential errors during database interaction properly.  It sends a generic 'Error' message to the client, providing no useful information for debugging.

## Solution
The solution includes:

* **Specific Error Handling:** Catches database errors and sends more informative error responses to the client, including appropriate HTTP status codes.
* **Logging:** Adds logging to help track and diagnose errors during development and production.
* **Input Validation:** (While not demonstrated in this minimal example, it's crucial to validate `userId` to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.)
